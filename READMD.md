# Network and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in C++

This project is an implementation of a network and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in C++. The KNN algorithm is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation.

## Usage
- ETL: This component is responsible for extracting, transforming, and loading data. It prepares the data for use in the machine learning algorithms.
- KNN: This component is an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It classifies data points based on their nearest neighbors in the dataset.
- K-Means: This component is an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. It partitions the dataset into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
- Neural Networks: This component is an implementation of a neural network. It can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the  task.
